# Quiz-game-project
In this project, I was asked to create a quiz game from scratch. First we created the HTML page with a bunch of IDs for the javascript to dynamically update later. Then we created the timer and interval functions that set and removed attributes from the start start screen and replaced it with a timer. Then we created two test questions and began working on the display question function that make up the main game. Then we created the check answer and end quiz functions to record correct answers and tally the final score. Then we created the save score function to store the score into local storage. Finally we used a show score function to create a standings screen based on all the inputs logged in local storage.
